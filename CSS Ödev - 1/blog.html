        Undertale is a 2D role-playing video game created by indie developer
        Toby Fox. The player controls a child who has fallen into the
        Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth,
        separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during
        the journey back to the surface. Some monsters might engage the player
        in a fight. The combat system involves the player navigating through
        mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify or
        subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them. These
        choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story
        changing based on outcomes.

        Outside of some artwork, Fox developed the entirety of the game by
        himself, including the script and music. The game took inspiration from
        several sources, including the Brandish, Mario & Luigi, and Mother
        role-playing series, bullet hell shooter series Touhou Project,
        role-playing game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and British comedy show Mr.
        Bean. Originally, Undertale was meant to be two hours in length and was
        set to be released in mid-2014. However, development was delayed over
        the next three years.

        The game was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in September 2015.
        It was also ported to Linux in July 2016, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation
        Vita in August 2017, the Nintendo Switch in September 2018, and Xbox One
        and Xbox Series X/S in March 2021. The game was acclaimed for its
        thematic material, intuitive combat system, musical score, originality,
        story, dialogue, and characters. The game sold over one million copies
        and was nominated for multiple accolades and awards. Several gaming
        publications and conventions listed Undertale as game of the year. The
        first chapter of a related game, Deltarune, was released in October
        2018.
